# Quishing

1. Once you scan a QR code, check the URL to make sure it is the intended site and looks authentic. A malicious domain name may be similar to the intended URL but with typos or a misplaced letter.

2. Practice caution when entering login, personal or financial information from a site navigated to from a QR code.

3. If scanning a physical QR code, ensure the code has not been tampered with, such as with a sticker placed on top of the original code.

4. Do not download an app from a QR code. Use your phone's app store for a safer download.

5. If you receive an email from a company you recently made a purchase with stating a payment failed and the company states you can only complete the payment through a QR code, call the company to verify. Locate the company's phone number through a trusted site rather than a number provided in the email.

6. Do not download a QR code scanner app. This increases your risk of downloading malware onto your device. Most phones have a built-in scanner through the camera app.

7. If you receive a QR code that you believe to be from someone you know, reach out to them through a known number or address to verify that the code is from them.

8.Review the preview of the QR code's URL before opening it to see if it appears legitimate. You can do this by opening your mobile device camera and pointing this at the QR code. This will identify the webpage link and provide the site address the code will take you to. Make sure the website uses HTTPS rather than HTTP, doesn't have obvious misspellings and has a trusted domain. Don't click on unfamiliar or shortened links.
